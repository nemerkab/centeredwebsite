            <p>
                At <strong>Centered</strong>, we rapidly build tech startups and create playbooks for launching and scaling companies. As part of <strong>The Customer Funded Startup Accelerator</strong>, we give founders direct access to experts who can help them move faster toward real customers and revenue.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re looking for a <strong>UX/UI Experience Designer</strong> to support startups during the <strong>first 4 weeks</strong> of the accelerator. This is a contractor role where you’ll provide design support that helps early-stage teams sharpen their products, offers, and customer experiences.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not a role to get rich off startups. Instead, it’s an opportunity to work closely with ambitious founders, build strong case studies, and gather testimonials that demonstrate the impact of your work.  
            </p>

                <li>Deliver a base level of design support during the accelerator, with the option for startups to directly engage you for additional hours.  </li>
                <li>Help founders move quickly from idea to testable, customer-facing experiences.  </li>

                <li>You’ll work with multiple startups at once, gaining insight into different industries and models.  </li>
                <li>You’ll help founders validate their products by designing experiences that drive presales and early traction.  </li>
                <li>You’ll leave with fresh case studies and testimonials from real startup projects.  </li>
            </ul>

                <li>Someone collaborative and flexible, able to give founders clear, practical next steps.  </li>
