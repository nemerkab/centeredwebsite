        <h1>Founder Development Deals</h1>
        <p>Why we're betting on the jockey -- and building a better way to do it.</p>
        <p>When a publisher bets on a debut novelist -- or a record label signs an unknown band -- they aren't buying a guaranteed outcome. They're investing in the possibility of something meaningful. They see a spark. They nurture it. They take a creative risk.</p>
        <p>Tech doesn't really do that. At least, not in any consistent or healthy way.</p>
        <p>We say we believe in "betting the jockey," but almost every structure in early-stage tech is designed to bet on horses: companies, products, metrics, markets. The founder is a means to an end, not the investment itself.</p>
        <p>That's the gap we want to fill.</p>
        <p>We're building a new kind of deal -- Founder Development Deals -- to back talented people before the company, before the pitch deck, before the traction. Just like the creative industries have always done.</p>

             <h2>The talent is out there. The structure isn't.</h2>
             <p>Some of the most compelling founders we've met are "between the lines." They might have an early-stage idea or a deep conviction in a space. Some just have a track record of building things, shipping quickly, and learning fast. But they haven't raised capital yet -- or don't want to until the idea is ready.</p>
             <p>So what do they do? They freelance, consult, or try to make rent while figuring things out on nights and weekends. It's not a lack of talent -- it's a lack of structure. There's no good way to support someone at this stage unless they already know exactly what they want to build.</p>
             <p>There's also no clean way for a studio, investor, or community to offer support without prematurely asking for co-founder-level equity or forcing them into a half-baked fundraise.</p>
             <p>So we asked: what if we borrowed a better structure?</p>



<h2>Inspiration from the creative world.</h2>
    <p>In publishing, promising writers get advances and editorial support to develop a book. In music, labels give artists studio time, producers, and marketing. In film, studios fund development deals -- sometimes years before anything is filmed.</p>
    <p>They bet on people first. The work comes next.</p>
    <p>That model is collaborative. It's human. It's long-term.</p>
    <p>And it works.</p>
    <p>We're adapting that playbook to help founders get their ideas off the ground in a way that's fair, flexible, and sustainable for both sides.</p>
 <h2>What's a Founder Development Deal?</h2>
    <p>At its core, a Founder Development Deal is a structured partnership: a 12-24 month agreement where we back a founder with time, resources, and support -- typically before the company exists. It's a way to nurture the jockey without asking them to already have a horse. Or if they want to change horses, that's fine too.</p> 
    <p>Founder Development Deals are earlier. More human. More creative. They're built for the moment when someone has potential -- not proof.</p>
    <p>We don't expect a company in week one. We expect curiosity, learning velocity, taste, and initiative. We want to work with people who show up with energy and care, not a resume or a cap table.</p>
    <p>We provide:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Monthly stipend:</strong> Enough to live and work full-time on exploration without immediate financial pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentorship and support:</strong> From experienced founders, product operators, and domain experts.</li>
    <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Access to designers, developers, and infrastructure to build and test early ideas.</li>
    <li><strong>Community:</strong> A cohort of like-minded entrepreneurs walking the same road.</li>
    <li><strong>Idea development:</strong> Some founders bring their own concepts. Others collaborate on ideas we've sourced and validated.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In return, the studio receives a modest stake in the venture that emerges. If nothing gets formed, we part ways with respect and goodwill (and may re-engage later).</p>
    <p>No pressure. No power grabs. No predatory terms. Just aligned incentives.</p>

    <h2>Why this model matters now.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Talent is everywhere. But access is not.</li>
        <li>Talented builders get priced out of early-stage exploration because they have rent to pay and no capital to burn.</li>
        <li>Non-traditional founders are disproportionately affected by the lack of structures that support solo, early-stage exploration.</li>
        <li>Burned-out founders need time to refocus and refound -- but the current system only rewards momentum.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By supporting people earlier, and more fairly, we widen the aperture of who gets to start companies and how.</p>
    <h3>This isn't charity. It's just better business.</h3>
    <p>Let's be clear: we're not lowering the bar. We're broadening the funnel.</p>
        <p>And we're playing a long game. Founder Development Deals are a smart, sustainable way for a studio to build a portfolio of amazing people  --  and the ventures they'll create across years and cycles.</p>
        <p>Some of our best returns may come not from the first project we work on together, but the second or third. That's how the creative industries think. That's how we think too.</p>

<h2>Want to build something together?</h2>
    <p>We're just getting started. If you're an early-stage founder (or a future one), we'd love to meet you. If you're a studio or investor curious about this model, let's jam. We partner with funding sources to provide the operations arm for the program.</p> 
    <p>We're here to bet on the next generation of changemakers. Not once they've proven themselves, but while they're still figuring it out.</p>
    <p>Just like great publishers, great producers, and great labels have always done.</p>
    <p>Let's bet on the jockeys. Let's build better pathways into entrepreneurship.</p>
