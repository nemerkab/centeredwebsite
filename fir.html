            <li>Prior experience working inside a legacy industry (as an operator, consultant, or domain specialist)</li>

            <li>Exposure to startup or innovation ecosystems where rapid experimentation and validation were key</li>
            <li>Strong analytical and systems-thinking mindset; ability to design scalable, tech-enabled solutions</li>
