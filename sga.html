        <h1>Startup Growth Associate (Part-Time)</h1>
        
        <div class="job-section">
            <p>
                At <strong>Centered</strong>, we rapidly build tech startups and create playbooks for launching and scaling companies. Through <strong>The Customer Funded Startup Accelerator</strong>, an 8-week, equity-free, hybrid program, we help founders validate ideas, presell offers, and unlock real revenue (not just pitch decks).
            </p>
            <p>
                We’re looking for a <strong>Startup Growth Associate</strong> to help power the accelerator, working closely with 5–10 startups as they sprint toward their first customers and sales. This role is hands-on: you’ll be in the trenches with founders, helping them move faster, test smarter, and focus on what drives growth.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="job-section">
            <h3>What you’ll explore</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What does it take to help a founder land their first paying customer <strong>before the product is fully built</strong>?  </li>
                <li>How fast can a startup move from idea to a presell offer in a single sprint?  </li>
                <li>How do you design pricing that actually funds business growth from Day One?  </li>
                <li>What does it look like to run three sales sprints in eight weeks and measure real revenue outcomes?</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Work closely with high-growth startups.</strong> Supporting other startups is one of the best ways to gain the skills you’ll need for your own venture.  </li>

                <li><strong>Build a founder network.</strong> Connect with ambitious founders, mentors, and investors who may become future collaborators, co-founders, or employers.  </li>
                <li><strong>See what actually works.</strong> Gain insider exposure to the playbooks that generate real customers and revenue, not just pitch decks.  </li>

                <li><strong>Super curious</strong> and eager to try new things.  </li>
                <li>A <strong>“how might we”</strong> mindset rather than “I don’t think that will work.”  </li>
                <li>Resourceful, organized, and excited to be around startups chasing real traction.  </li>

                <li><strong>Location:</strong> We’d like to work in-person, but you don’t need to be on-site every day. Most weeks are hybrid with remote work, but there will be a couple of in-person days with the whole cohort at <em>The Next Center</em> in Holland, MI.  </li>
