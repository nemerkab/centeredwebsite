        <h1>Refounding startups</h1>
        <p>
          At Centered, we believe some startups deserve a second life. Too often, companies with a great product or breakthrough technology are sidelined not by market forces but by structural missteps—under-capitalization, an ineffective go-to-market strategy, overly complex cap tables, governance breakdowns, misaligned incentives, and gaps in operational support. That’s where our “refounding” studio comes in.
          When we refound a company, we:

          <br />
          <br />
          Acquire the full business: We purchase your equity and assets so every decision is aligned around a unified growth plan.
          
          <br />
          <br />
          Rehabilitate the foundation: We tackle the blockers that held you back—whether it’s under-capitalization that starved operations, an ill-fitting go-to-market playbook, a tangled cap table, or governance and incentive structures that no longer serve your vision.

          <br />
          <br />
          Install a new operating team: We hand-pick seasoned operators and functional leaders to run day-to-day, while preserving the vision and technical insights you’ve already established.

          <br />
          <br />
          Define your ongoing role: Founders often transition into a strategic, “silent” capacity—serving on the board or as an advisor with a modest equity position—so you stay connected to the upside without daily operational duties.

          <br />
          <br />
          Accelerate growth with proven playbooks: Leveraging Centered’s studio toolkit, we relaunch initiatives across marketing, sales, product development, and finance—turning past obstacles into catalysts for renewed momentum.
          
          <br />
          <br />
          Who This Isn’t For
          <br />
          Founders seeking only a cash infusion or standalone services—our model is full acquisition plus deep structural work.
          <br />
          Entrepreneurs who want to maintain day-to-day control and a large equity stake—refounding means handing off daily execution in exchange for a strategic board or advisory role.
          
          
          We’re not here to start from scratch. We honor the hard work and insights you’ve poured in, while applying the right capital, strategy, and talent to revive and scale what you’ve built. Our goal is simple: transform a paused venture into a thriving business by getting the structure, team, and roles exactly right.
          If your company has reached a crossroads—or you see structural cracks forming—let’s explore how Centered can refound and relaunch your vision. We’d welcome the chance to walk you through our process, outline your board/advisory role and equity position, and chart a path to renewed growth.
